# FxRuntime

Custom, self-contained JavaFX runtimes for running JavaFX applications without requiring a full JDK installation.

## Overview

**FxRuntime** provides prebuilt Java runtimes that bundle:
- The full Java Development Kit (JDK)
- All JavaFX modules (JavaFX SDK & JMODs)
- Ready-to-run `bin/java` executable
- Optimized size (stripped debug info, man pages, and headers)

These runtimes are created with [`jlink`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/core/jlink.html), ensuring they are portable and only include the modules needed to run JavaFX applications.
